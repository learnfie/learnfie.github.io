After a lot of procrastination, I have finally got it all together and started the blog again.

It's been quite a while that I created the first tutorial on YouTube. Although I received a few encouragements, yet everything got washed up due to work & life.

Finally, I have got enough courage & motivation to start it all over again. I hope that this time motivation stays with me.

I'm planning to create a few tutorial series and review a few others for you guys to follow.

Stay in touch, see you soon.
